            <img src="./assets/images/portfolio-picture.png"/>
            <p>I am a student of the KU Coding Boot Camp. I like reading, mathematics, and video games.</p>
            <p>My favorite book series is Tolkien's Legendarium. It is good and has a bigger corpus than most people know. Other book series I like are Discworld, Dinosaur Lords, and the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>
            <p>My favorite mathematical field is quaternions. Quaternions were discovered in 1843 by William Hamilton and they are used to describe movement in 3-dimensional space.</p>
            <p>My favorite video game series is Kingdom Hearts. It got me back into Disney and is a fun expirience. Other games I have enjoyed include "Jak and Daxter", "Elder Scrolls: Skyrim", and "Destroy All Humans".</p>
